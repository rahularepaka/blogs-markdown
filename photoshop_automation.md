# **Bots behind Engima Instagram Page**

Handling Instagram pages every day is **quite tiring** for getting the information, editing the post, and uploading them on the Instagram page.

To handle this process, we decided to **automate this entire process** which includes the following:
- Editing the post on Photoshop
- Exporting to the desired format
- Uploading them on Bulk Instagram post dump tools

Initially, we planned on doing the **manual way** of posting content on Instagram to understand the process before automating it using bots and code.

We made **templates** for the content for each day and also **collect the data** in an excel document in our shared cloud folders such as Onedrive.

These we are our *content planned for the week*:

| Day       | Post           |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Monday    | Fact           |
| Tuesday   | Python Library |
| Wednesday | Innovators     |
| Thursday  | Algorithm      |
| Friday    | Repost         |
| Saturday  | Series         |
| Sunday    | Movie          |

Once we decided the type of contents for the week, we had to **start designing the templates** for each day using **photoshop**.

Then, we moved to collecting data which includes **media path and information**. For example, **Sunday** we need name of the **movie, rating and picture of the movie**, so we collected and organized information like this:

| movie                     | rating | pic                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| The Social Network        | 7.7    | D:\\engima\_psd\\Sunday\\takedown.jpg  |
| Takedown                  | 6.3    | D:\\engima\_psd\\Sunday\\pirates.png   |
| Pirates of Silicon Valley | 7.2    | D:\\engima\_psd\\Sunday\\social.jpg    |
| The Imitation Game        | 8      | D:\\engima\_psd\\Sunday\\imidation.jpg |
| The Fifth Estate          | 6.2    | D:\\engima\_psd\\Sunday\\fifth.jpg     | 

Upon the reciveing the information in excel format, we have converted them into **CSV** (**Comma-Separated Values**) which helps softwares and our code better to read the files

For automating the editing process, we have used photoshop and recently, the updated version contained **batch automation** which helps us do something like by uploading the csv file.

Which finally leads to uploading them on **bulk uploading instagram platform**.Intailly, we planned on **coding the platform** which took read the csv file and upload a particular post based on the time and date but ***instagram API didn't work*** unless we have a *instagram certified platform developer tools*.

So we chose a free platform called **Combin Scheduler** but this required the application to **run in the background** and PC/Computer to **be turned on all the time** and during the posting date and time but was ***difficult***.

Hence, we had a **desktop environment server based on India** which had the platform running **24/7** and later we would move this environment to our college server.

All thanks to **@cybertruma** and **@srikar** for ***setting up the server*** and making the platform running.
